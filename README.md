# Basic DP

---

This repository contains the code required for very fundamental forms of Dynamic Programming. Why these can be considered fundamental is an opinion based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go) series by Aditya Verma. Hopefully it will always contain a clear solution to most of the problems realted to DP.
